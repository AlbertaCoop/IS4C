Provides more WHERE conditions to filter irrelevant transaction
records, as a stop-gap until this is handled more uniformly across the
application.  At least one condition where these additional conditions
are needed is when the table dlog_15 is used, for which no filters are
provided (since it's a table, not a view).  Other report classes may
have this issue, and thus also need this stop-gap.  The real solution
probably lies in uniformly using views, such as dlog.
